# Gomoku Game

Gomoku is a traditional board game where two players (or one player against an artificial intelligence) compete to place five pieces in a row on a game board. This project is built using Python and utilizes the Pygame library to create a graphical interface.

## Project Contents

The project consists of two main files:

1. **gmkanimation.py**:

   - Contains functions to draw the user interface, including the menu screen, member information, and the end game screen.
   - Defines colors and sizes for the game board.
   - Provides functionality to check for winners and display messages.

2. **Gomoku.py**:
   - Contains the game logic, including the `GomokuAI` class to handle moves from the AI and functions to process player moves.
   - Implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize the AI's moves.
   - Manages the main game loop, processes user events, and updates the game state.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed. You can install Pygame using pip: "pip install pygame"
